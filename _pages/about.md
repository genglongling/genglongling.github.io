Welcome! I am **Longling Geng**, a student at **Stanford University**, specializing in Software Systems and Artificial Intelligence. My academic focus lies in **large language models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent systems**, **convex optimization**, and **reinforcement learning**. At Stanford University, I am working closely with Prof. Mert Pilanci and Prof. Edward Chang. During undergraduate, I am working closely with Prof. Qing Li and Prof. Kai Zhou. I am also gratitude for valuable guidance and past collaboration with Prof. Andrew Ng (Stanford), Prof. James Zou (Stanford), Prof. Jonathan Chen (Stanford), Dr. Yajun Fang (MIT), Prof. Wei Lou (HKPolyU), Prof. Hong Va Leong (HKPolyU), Prof. Chun Bun Henry Chan (HKPolyU), and Prof. Dennis Liu (HKPolyU).

## üìç Current Position

- **Research Collaboration:**, Stanford OVAL Lab, Stanford InfoLab, Prof. Mert's Group, Hazy Research, and Stanford ML Group.
- **Startup:** KCUBE-AI (Seed-round investment by Stanford InfoLab, Hong Kong Science and Technology Park Ideation Program, KTEO, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
